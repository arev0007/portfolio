**Portfolio Website**

The portfolio website is created by adding 5 pages: homepage, services, creative, about, and contact page. 

The homepage contains an overview of each page.
The services page reflects my skills. 
The about page contains the bio information. 
The contact page contains a form contact. 


 ##Challenges
 Different difficulties were faced during the project. Not only adjusting the images, but also making the website responsive. So, the images were optimised and adjusted using bootstrap. Also, working on css in detail helped to make it responsive. 

##Skills
This project allowed me to learn essential information. Add and work on accessibility to enhance the user experience. Moreover, using complex selectors, pseudo elements, and custom properties are useful for working in css. Also, learning about media query and bootstrap help to adjust the style for different screen sizes.
